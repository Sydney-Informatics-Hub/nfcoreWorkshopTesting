# Exercise 4: Customise execution - further practice

## Objectives 
- Create a custom config for multiqc
- Add the custom config details to the parameters YAML file 
- Run with the -resume flag
- This exercise provides practice in:
  - Reading the documentation and selecting parameters that are suited to the specific data analysis at hand
  - Creating another configuration file
  - Editing a parameters YAML file
  - Observing the order of priorities for configuration - like nextflow, the multiqc parameters are read from the main multiqc tool, with our locally psecified parameters overriding these
  - Observing the behaviour of nextflow cache and the '-resume' flag; only the multiqc module was changed and so only this part was re-run, while all other tasks were recovered from cache
